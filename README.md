# JSON to LaTeX

`principal_curvatures_can` is a library for computing signed principal curvatures in PCL point clouds.
This is done using the method described in _Robust curvature estimation and geometry analysis of 3D point cloud surfaces_ by Zhang et. al.


## Building

This library can be built by running the following commands,

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

An example of how to use this library is available in the `example` directory.
